# Stock-prediction-and-forecasting-using-sentiment-analysis

The stock market offers one of the biggest returns on the market, but it is exceedingly difficult to predict stock prices because there are no set standards for doing so. Despite their volatility, one can still visualize share prices and other statistical data to make an informed decision on which company to invest their money in. This project will allow us to predict and forecast stock prices based on news headlines and historic data sets. Additionally, we can forecast future stock prices using machine learning techniques.

We saw that the new user was afraid to invest in the share market because he did not have the knowledge and did not have any tool with the help of which he could do this work. So, we decided to design a machine learning model for stock prediction and forecasting with the help of deep learning techniques, which can tell in a very precise way where the market will move by analysing things. 
Step 1: We will do this by taking an input data set consisting of 8 years of data from Dow jones Industrial average.
Step 2: We imported this data and analysed it with the help of a machine-learning model. 
Step 3: We will focus on data pre-processing after pre-processing the data, the System reads stock price history and gives input to the Backpropagation algorithm.
Step 4. We will be using sentiment analysis to predict stock prices based on the top news headlines provided by the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Step.5: Further , we will incorporate the model of Deep Learning Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to add historic data sets too in our model so that our model will be able to predict stock prices based on the news headlines and historic data sets.
